Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

a collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

String cats[] = new int [10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?

An array of arrays

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

int scores[][] = new int [6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

sout dogs[10]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

Thrown when an out-of-range index is detected by an array object.
An out-of-range index occurs when the index is less than zero or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
 sout array.length[] -2

 ??????????????


8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
no max

9) What is a bubble sort?

 A way to sort an array from lowest to highest

10) How does a bubble sort work?

for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) sout i

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

while (i < array.length){
sout i
