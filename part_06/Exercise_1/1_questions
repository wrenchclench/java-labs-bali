1) What is Java inheritance?

When the variables and methods of a sub class are inherited from a super class.

2) How does inheritance work?

By using the extends keyword.

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?

Reduced reptition of code when you want a class to have access to the same variables and methods.

4) What does the "super" keyword do?

Calls a constructor defined by the super class.

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?

Top to bottom. From the highest superclass down.

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?

When a method in a subclass is the same as a method in the superclass the subclass method overrides the superclass method.

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?

Will allow the same object to execute different methods based on class accessed.

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?

Overloaded will accept multiple parameters. Overridden is when the signature is the same as a method in the super class
and the subclass method is run instead of the super class method.

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?

the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time instead of at compile time.

10) What does the "final" keyword do?

Prevents overriding of your code.

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?

Object
