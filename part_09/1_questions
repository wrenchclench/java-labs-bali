1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?

Bytestream - designed for handling input and output of bytes
Character stream - designed for handling input and output of characters

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?

Inputstream, Outputstream, Dataoutpustream.

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
BufferedReader
BufferedWriter
FileReader

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
A way to automatically release a file when it's not being used. This helps reduce memory leaks.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

try (resource-specification) {
some code
}

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?

an integer value

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)

 * A <code>FileInputStream</code> obtains input bytes
 * from a file in a file system. What files
 * are  available depends on the host environment.
 *
 * <p><code>FileInputStream</code> is meant for reading streams of raw bytes
 * such as image data. For reading streams of characters, consider using
 * <code>FileReader</code>.

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?

bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?

Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of
characters, arrays, and lines.


10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?

InputStreamReader creates a new stream object that can be used to read data from the specified source


11) What does the InputStreamReader do with it's byte stream argument?

It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset


12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?

Read only reads a single character, readline reads a whole line of text


13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
