1) Turn the following into a Generic interface:

   public interface Consumer {
       public void consume(String parameter)
   }

2) What are a few advantages of using Generic types?

3) What is Type Erasure?

4) Assuming the following snippet:

    public static <T> T returnType(T argument) {
        return argument;
    }

    Does this work?
    Integer i = returnType(1);
    String s = returnType("String");

5) What is a Bounded Type Parameter?

6) Demonstrate the use of Generic Wildcard in a method signature:

7) What are bounded and unbounded wildcards in Generics?

8) What is difference between List<? extends T>  and  List <? super T> ?
