1) Describe the exception hierarchy.

All exception classes are dervied from the class Throwable. Error and Exception are subclasses of Throwable.

2) What is a try/catch statement?

code that will monitor another code block for errors. when errors are encountered they will correspond to the exception handler
in the catch block.

3) Why do we use try/catch statements?

To handle and provide feedback our code is running in a manner in which we do not want it to run.

4) Write a full example of a try/catch/finally statement that catches two distinct exceptions

try {
some code
{
catch (except1) {
return nope!
}
catch (except2) {
return nope!
}
finally {
return just stop trying
}

5) What does it mean to "throw" an exception? How does it work?

When a method generates an exception it does not handle. It throws the exception into another method which is built to handle it.

6) What happens if your application encounters an exception and you don't catch it or throw it?

It will not run.

7) When catching exception in an inheritance hierarchy, should you catch the subclass exception or the
superclass exception first? Why?

The subclass exception because the exception will be specific to that subclass.

8) Write a nested try/catch statement.

try {
some code
    try {
    some code
    }
    catch{
    some code }
    catch {
    some code
    }

9) What does it mean to rethrow an exception?

To throw the exception to the main method even though it was also in a catch statement. This is so that we still see in the console
what went wrong and also that the catch logic dealt with it.

10) What are the 7 methods that come with the Throwable class?
 Throwable fillInStackTrace( )
 String getLocalizedMessage( )
 String getMessage( )
 void printStackTrace( )
 void printStackTrace(PrintStream stream)
 void printStackTrace(PrintWriter stream)
 String toString( )

11) What does the "finally" block do?
Execute a block of code when control from the try catch is left.

12) When is the finally block executed? Will it ever not be executed?
when control from the try catch is left. no.

13) What are the three recently added features to Java exceptions?

automatic resource management, multi-catch, final rethrow
