Demonstrate throwing an exception. Create at least two classes. ClassA and ClassB. ClassA should have the main() method.
The main() method needs to call a method in ClassB. This method in ClassB must generate and throw an exception back to
ClassA. ClassA must either handle that exception or throw that exception back to the JVM.
